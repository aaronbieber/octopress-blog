# The Chronicle

The Chronicle of a ColdFusion Expatriate is my personal technical blog built
with Jekyll and Octopress 3.0. This version supersedes the previous incarnation
built with Octopress before it was a proper gem.

This project may be of little to no interest to anyone as software, but you can
read its amazing content at http://blog.aaronbieber.com.

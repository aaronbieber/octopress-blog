# The Chronicle

The Chronicle of a ColdFusion Expatriate is my personal technical blog built
with Jekyll and Octopress 3.0. This version supersedes the previous incarnation
built with Octopress before it was a proper gem.

This project may be of little to no interest to anyone as software, but you can
read its amazing content at http://blog.aaronbieber.com.

## Install/Build

The rough steps required to make this thing go:

1. Install rbenv (`brew install rbenv`).

2. Install bundler (`sudo gem install bundler`).

3. Adjust the path to compass-core in `_config.yml` to reflect the actual vendor
   path in the project (this varies depending on what version got installed).

5. It should work!

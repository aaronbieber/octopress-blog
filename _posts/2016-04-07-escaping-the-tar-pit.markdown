If you don't know by now, I'm sort of a personal efficiency maven. I don't like
to waste keystrokes, I'm always experimenting with different key bindings and
shortcuts, and I feel almost personally offended when I see someone reach for
their mouse to click a button that I know has a keyboard equivalent.

But this isn't about my pet peeves; this is about tuning yourself in to the
improvements you can make on a daily basis that will increase your lifetime
efficiency dramatically.

I had the opportunity to give a "lightning talk" at the Boston PHP meetup, so I
spoke on this topic. It went OK, so I gave it again at Wayfair and I let them
record it. The recording quality is not the best, but I think the point comes
across just fine.

The talk is called "Escaping the Tar Pit: Principles of Continuous Improvement."
Video and full slides after the break.~~MORE~~

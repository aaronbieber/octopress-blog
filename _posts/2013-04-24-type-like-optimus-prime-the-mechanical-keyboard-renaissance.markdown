Set aside for the moment the fact that Optimus Prime's defining characteristic 
is his ability to *transform*. Pretend, instead, that he's just an enormous, 
sentient robot. That's what your keyboard would be like if you had mechanical 
key switches in there. Maybe you already do and this is old hat; if that is 
the case, move along. But if you want to learn about Cherry MX Blues and the 
siren song of the Rosewills and the Leopolds, by all means, read on.

Most keyboards do not have mechanical key switches. The reason for this is 
quite simple: mechanical key switches are more expensive to manufacture. 
That's really the only reason I can come up with.

To the contrary, most keyboards have some type of "conductive rubber pad" 
mechanism, which usually consists of a single circuit board, a rubber overlay 
that provides resistance to key presses and holds conductive rubber pads above 
a grid of switch-like breaks in the circuit board traces. When you press down 
on a key, you are depressing one of the rubber "bumps," which eventually 
collapses and allows the conductive pad to touch the circuit board underneath, 
completing the circuit.

Making keyboards this way has a few advantages:

1.  The materials and manufacturing are really cheap.
2.  The parts can be extruded or molded and assembled by machines.
3.  The keyboards are typically quiet and comfortable to use, which is 
    appealing in the modern office environment.

Unfortunately, there are also disadvantages. The primary disadvantage is that 
commodity keyboards fail quickly; generally in under a couple million key 
presses, but by comparison to mechanical key switch keyboards they often have 
a cheap or flimsy feel during use. Even the nicer conductive keyboards pale in 
comparison to the feeling of pressing down on an actual, mechanical button.

So what makes mechanical key switches better? How about another list?

1.  Most mechanical key switches (the popular ones) are made by companies that 
    do not make keyboards, they only make key switches. This specialization 
    results in a higher quality product.
2.  Rather than failing after one or two million key presses, mechanical key 
    switches are generally expected to survive thirty, forty, or fifty million 
    key presses before succumbing to the wear and tear of their owner's 
    constant hammering.
3.  They feel awesome to type on. Seriously. There are a few types of key 
    switches, which I will go over, and they all feel so much better to type 
    on than your run-of-the-mill Microsoft or Dell keyboard.
4.  Geek cred. More on this at the end.

Have you guys seen this? Github can generate a "resume" based on your 
github.com account listing the projects you own and organizations you're 
affiliated with. This is **such** a neat idea!

You can see mine for example: [resume.github.com/?aaronbieber][1], just 
replace my username with yours to see your own Github resume.

I stumbled upon this thanks to Gina Trapani on Google Plus. Though it's 
flattering for Github to refer to me as an "advanced" Github user, Gina is a 
"passionate" github user. I think I have a distance to go yet...

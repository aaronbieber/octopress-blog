I’ll try to keep this brief. Five years ago, I left my job as a production PHP 
programmer at a national consulting firm (business consulting, not development 
consulting) to take a job writing ColdFusion at a startup on the other side of 
the state.

Since then, I have learned the ins and outs of an arcane version of ColdFusion 
while using more modern languages, such as Ruby and Python, only in my spare 
time. Finally, after all these years, the business sees fit to undertake a 
rewrite and to leave ColdFusion behind. After much deliberation, PHP was 
chosen.

Let us keep the snickers to a minimum; PHP is still the language with the 
broadest adoption and is therefore among the easiest to hire for. As it turns 
out, a lot has changed in PHP since I left my previous position.

This blog will be a chronicle of my discoveries, solutions to odd problems, 
and probably also an outpouring of affection for Vim, my favorite editor.

```php
<?php
public function __construct() {
    try_to_enjoy_yourselves();
}
```

I may also talk about bash scripting, because bash is cool. Here’s a freebie.

```bash
function ll() {
    ls -G -lho "$@";
}
```

title: "Don't Be Typecast By PHP"
---

When I tell people I meet that I am a PHP developer, it's not too unusual for
them to scoff or even laugh. In spite of PHP's enormous popularity, its
unflinching support by the unstoppable Facebook engineering machine, and its
continuous and impressive improvement as a language year after year, many people
in the software industry are openly derisive toward PHP.

Don't let PHP's own reputation sully yours; don't let PHP itself typecast you.

Unlike most other languages used on the Internet, PHP enjoys an incredibly broad
appeal. Although broad appeal is generally a good thing, the statement "I am a
PHP developer" is now meaningless. What does it mean to be a "PHP developer?" To
say that you work primarily in PHP, on its face, is like saying that you drive a
vehicle for a living.

Postal workers, couriers, cab drivers, F1 race car drivers, long-haul truckers,
even perhaps forklift operators could be considered to drive a vehicle for a
living. To say that you drive a vehicle for a living is nearly meaningless, and
I believe that identifying yourself as someone who uses PHP is exactly the same.

PHP is used by WordPress, Drupal, Magento, and many other open- and
closed-source systems that are wildly popular. Many make a living building
systems around these products or extending them. At the same time, a huge number
of bespoke applications are using PHP because it's easy to set up, free, and
talent is relatively easy to find to support it.

The thing is... Knowing PHP doesn't necessarily mean you're talented.

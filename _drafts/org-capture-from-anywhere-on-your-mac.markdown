title: "Org Capture From Anywhere on Your Mac"
---

Fair warning: this is a Mac-only post. What I will talk about is surely possible
in Windows, but I have no idea how, so don't ask. If you do know (or find out)
feel free to use the comments section to share your knowledge with everyone else
here.

I'm going to show you how you can create a "bookmarklet" button in your browser
that will capture a note or link directly into Org Mode in your running
Emacs. That's right, you press a button in, say, Chrome, and Emacs pops up and
displays your Org capture interface with the current webpage's information in it.

How is this achieved? Through a little bit of magic called "Org Protocol."

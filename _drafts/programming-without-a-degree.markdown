title: "Programming Without a Degree"
---

Programming is one of the few highly technical fields where a degree is, quite
frankly, unnecessary. Useful, perhaps; of significant value, maybe; but
necessary, no.

Let's not confuse "programming" with "computer science." Programming is teaching
a computer how to do something whereas computer science is a more abstract
exploration of computers and how they work. As a trite example, programming is
making a website that sells, let's say, furniture, and computer science is
developing neural networks that can recognize objects in photographs.

Computer science fuels the discovery that makes productive programming possible,
but programming is all you need to know to get paid to work with computers.
